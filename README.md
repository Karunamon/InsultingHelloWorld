InsultingHelloWorld
-------------------

This project was borne out of a desire to learn various programming languages, at least on a very basic level.

Everyone knows the universal hello world program. You get the code to output "Hello, world!" to your console,
and there you have it.

But, if you're trying to go a bit deeper into the language, this isn't enough to really "show you the ropes".

This program was built out of amusement at the frequent "holy wars" had over programming languages at my place
of employment. It's a truism that all languages suck (every language will have something that someone doesn't like),
so why not take a shot at every language, and while we're at it, use some of the data structures and looping
constructs that each language has in an attempt to make a slightly-more-fully-featured "hello world" program?

Needless to say, this will be very opinionated :)
